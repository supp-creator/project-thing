# NOTEBOOK

LBYCPA1 Final Project

## DESCRIPTION

A command line tool that can create new text files and automatically encrypt them.

Anyone can open the file. But they won't be able to read it due to the encryption.

To decrypt the file, it must be opened through the NOTEBOOK command line tool.

To open the file through the command line tool, the user must first log-in.

This CLT only supports one user and by extension, only one password.

If you forget your password, womp womp. 

Anyone can delete any text file. That's just how it goes.
